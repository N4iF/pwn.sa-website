Hello, my name is Naif. I like to pwn and testing machines on TryHackMe and Hack The Box, as well as some other platforms. I also often build virtual machines on my own device to understand how to construct them and practice more. I used to spend my time on bug bounty, but my focus has shifted more towards **red teaming in Active Directory**. I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but I'm working towards it.
